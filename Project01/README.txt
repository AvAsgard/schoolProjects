# Project 1: PlayList Analyzer

* Author: Cameron Bentley
* Class: CS121 Section 6
* Semester: Fall 2018 

## Overview

This Java application asks for user input regarding the title of a song, the artist, file path, and length of the song. 
It then displays the average play time between these songs, finds the song closest to 4 minutes in length, and finally 
prints each song title, artist, file path, and length of song in a table.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac PlayList.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java PlayList
```

You will be prompted for a song title, song artist, file path for the song, and the length of the song three times, for a 
total of 12 required user inputs. After that the code will use this information to produce the results listed in the 
'Overview' section of this README file.
